# Î£-Protocols

This repo contains a specification for implementing $\Sigma$-protocols in the DLOG setting, with AND and OR composition. **[A compiled pdf version is available](https://github.com/zkpstandard/wg-sigma-protocols/blob/build/sigma.pdf).**
This working group is part of the [zkproof standardization effort](zkproof.org).

## Contributing

Here is a list of elements that are not currently part of the standard but should be in the near future:
- Encoding and sharing of the statement being proven
- Section on lattice-based proofs
- Providing reference implementations in different languages
